Que: Difference between Interface and Abstract Class?
Ans:
1.Interface implements 100% abstraction all the methods are public and abstract and all the variables are final and static.
whereas in abstract class you can implements 0 to 100% abstraction. It contains both types of methods abstract and non-abstract.

but after java 8 you can create default method which is not abstract and automatically implemented.

2. Interface can extend Interface but can't implement any class whereas Abstract class extends other class and implements interface.
