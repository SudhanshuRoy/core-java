Explain the difference between Checked and Unchecked exception?

ans:
1. Exceptions which are checked at compile time only by compiler is know as checked or compile time exceptions.
all the classes which inherits throwable class directly except run time error and exception is know as  checked exceptions.
example: IOException,SQL exceptions

2.Exceptions which are not checked at compile time or even if you not handle or declare compiler will not give you
any error but unchecked exception are checked at runtime for example: ArrayOutOfBondException, NullPointerException,
ArithmeticException.
