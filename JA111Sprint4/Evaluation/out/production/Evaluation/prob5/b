b. When should you use a Set over a List?
ans:
1. list allow duplicates whereas set don't allow duplicates i.e, in list you can add same element more than once
but in case of set you can't.
2. list maintain insertion order i.e, it stores element in the same order as you put into it whereas in case of set
it changes its order randomly.
