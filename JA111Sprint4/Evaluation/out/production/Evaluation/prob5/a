When should you use LinkedList over ArrayList?
ans:
ArrayList is dynamic array searching element is affordable but frequently insertion and deletion in arraylist is
quit expensive. In insertion or deletion you have to shift all the element one index right from insertion point to end.
and lly in deletion you have to shift forward.
  Whereas in arraylist insertion and deletion is affordable we can easily inset of delete element form any position
  and we don't have any element forward of backward. for this advantage you should use LinkedList over ArrayList.
